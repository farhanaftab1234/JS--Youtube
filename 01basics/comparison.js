// comparing two opearnds of same datatypes is easy 
// things gets confusing when either of the one operands is of different types

// == this operator should be avoided because it only compares the value not the datatype instead of this use triple equal ===

// Comparing null with zero wuth diff comparison

// note here comparison operator is converting null to zero and comparing with 0 and equality operator is not converting null to zero
